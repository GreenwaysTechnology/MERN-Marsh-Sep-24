What is Next?
	 Next is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast "web applications".

What is React?
         React is javascript lib to build "Single Page Web applications"/SPA 

What is web app?
  Type of distributed app,deployed at server , accessed over network(internet) vi various network protocals like http,tcp,smtp...
  
  Web apps works based on request and response model.
  Web apps are hosted on server called web server.

Web server receives request , runs a program, that program returns response to the client.

Response would be document.
=>HTML

other responses types
XML,JSON,Documents,images,vidoes.........

What is web and why it was created?

  Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.


The first Web browser is line mode web browser,launched in 1992.
The first web server is NeXT computer
The first web page , lanuched http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html


Technology stack:
................
1.HTML
2.Webserver - Next Computer
3.LineMode Web Browser
4.HTTP protocal.

Types of Web application:

1.Static web applications - 1989 to 1995
    Hard coded html pages, Prepared html pages kept at server, the web server will send those html pages to clients - browsers

Do you think Static web applications still exits?
  Yes!, but we dont prepare the html pages by hand.. rather we ask the server to prepare..

2.Dynamic Content generation application(1996 to till date)

  After 1995, many people thought that how we can use web for biz information system

 How to share biz informations via internet?
 Generally biz data is stored in databases , how to embed database data into html pages.


 1.web server need to talk to database
 2.web server need to prepare html pages based on database records
 3.Those information must be transported to web clients.


Web server core design to get client request and send html response to the client.

Along with web server, something was introduced called "Programming language runtime"

Tech stacks:

1.CGI With C language and perl script.
2.Java Servlets and JSP
3.Active Server pages - ASP
4.PHP

3.Web services-1998 to till date

 Rise of ECommerce, using internet and web how to exchange data between two biz organizations.
 The existing html technology was not suitable to send and recive data because html is just user interface document language.

 We need , data to be exechanged, thats where new data model was created called 'XML'
xml based web apps called web services.

SOAP protocal was created to transfer XML based documents "SOAP based webservices"

After 2005 SOAP based web services, started failing due to mobile computing.

New Web services  were designed called "RestFull Web services"

Restfull web services were used to build any type of data formats like json,xml,pdf,html etc...

4.Client side web apps called "Single Page Web Apps"(2007 to till date)

Single page web apps are built using javascript at client side where as server side web services(REST apis) are used.

SPA Tech stack:
HTML 5,CSS 3, Javascript.

Frameworks build based on SPA

1.Angular js |Angular
2.react js
3.vue js
...................................................................................
.....................................................................................
				React as SPA lib
.....................................................................................

Reactjs was created by facebook , in order to build SPA applications for browsers.


Advantages of SPA:
1.Pages are created  at client side, so server load is completly removed
2.SPA reduces the lot of phsyical pages after deployment.
3.Clear separations of concerns.

Drawbacks of SPA:
.................

Pure client SPAs are problematic when the app is senstive to SEO and
Time-to concept ,This is because the browser will recive a large empty HTML page and has to wait until the javascript is loaded before rendering any thing.

	    The brith of new Technology called  "SSR" -  Server Side Rendering
    ..................................................................................
			Server side Rendering
...................................................................................

I need SEO but at the same time, i want to use SPA as well.

We provide first class api to "render"  an SPA app into HTML strings on the server.

This allows server to send back already rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the javascript is being downloaded.

Hydration:
  This process is called "hydration", the app is compiled at server side and sent to the client which will be  interactive.

.....................................................................................			           Rendering Types
.....................................................................................

What is Rendering?
   Render means preparation,HTML Page prepartion...

Rendering Types:
1.CSR- Client side Rendering.
   HTML Pages are prepared at client side - SPA Applications
2.SSR  -Server Side rendering
   HTML Pages are prepared at server side - Dynamic Content Generation applications.
		 

Based on these rendering type, we can classify other rendering

1.Universal rendering /Hybrid Rendering
  Server + Client side , coimbing both rendering 

2.Full SSR and Partial SSR
    Partial SSR is nothing but only "index.html" is compiled at server , rest of the application is rendered at client side.
   Full SSR is nothing but "index.html" and other pages are compiled at server....

.....................................................................................
			When Rendering can happen
		     (when html pages are parepared)
....................................................................................
1.Request time
2.Build time

1.Request time :
 When user types url 

  http://www.example.com/product--------------->Server Receives Request----Prepares Page--send   that page to client.
 Technologies : jsp,asp,php


2.Build time
    Build is nothing but, preparing app for production.. before hosting we have to prepare the   app
  During build phase, we can prepare html pages/render html pages 

SSG -  Static Site Generations:
...............................

Building web sites/apps during build phase is called SSG.

Why SSG?
  Super fast page access

Based On SSG , There is specfication is available "JAM Stack"
.....................................................................................
			Drawback of SSG(JAMStack App)
..........................................................................................
If page has data, which is keep on changing, preparing a page "ahead of time", that causes problem. that means we cant generate page on demand...

Data changes rapidly , we need to enable request time page prepartion.
.....................................................................................
			    SSR + SSG

During build process, we have to enable SSG, during runtime not for all pages we need to enable SSR (Request Time page Preparation)

....................................................
			ISR - Incremental Static Rendenering
.....................................................................................

SSG - Build time or ahead of time
SSR - Request time

ISR = SSG + SSR - Build time + request time 
.....................................................................................

What is Nextjs?

  Next js is a framework that helps to build web apps of all types

 you can build Full SSR apps..
 you can build SSR With Request time
 you can build SSG with Build time -  JAMStacks
 you can build SSR with CSR  - Server + SPA - Hybrid rendering
 you can build rest apis also - Web services
 You cant build pure SPA apps like react with redux.

Using Next you can build 
 Pure server side apps with database access, other external api access.....
.....................................................................................
	               Next js UI layer - Next JS APP architecture
.....................................................................................
Next js uses "react core features" to build UI layer...

React core features:
1.React compoent driven
2.React uses data mutation techniques like props and state
3.React uses event listeners for interactions
4.React hooks


Nextjs tech stack:

1.React as ui layer
2.Next does not recommend to use "redux"
3.Next uses api layer- rest api development
4.Next can talk to any database via orm frameworks...

.....................................................................................
			Next js framework and Runtime Architecture:
.....................................................................................

Next js uses "Rust based build system" where as react uses web pack build ....

What is Rust?
 It is programming langugage, used to build Nextjs apps. Next core engine is written in Rust only.

Next.js Compiler:
..................
 Next js Compiler is written using RUST Using SWC (Speedy Web Compiler).
https://swc.rs/docs/getting-started

SWC allows next js to transform and minify the js code for production. This replaces babel.

SWC is 17x faster than Babel, it is embeded inside next js

			Next.js Application Architecture
.....................................................................................

Next.js app is server side app, so for each web page ,the html page is created.
...................................................................................
	  Next App is conventional over Configuration based
.....................................................................................

             "In Next every folder and files are predefined"

1.In next, there is no predefined index.html, because index.html is generated by next server during request time or build time.

File Names:
  src/app

1.page.js
2.layout.js

	 These file names are predefined, we cant change file names as we wish.

File Names have been designed based on conventional over configuration,meaning every file has meaning.


page.js
   It is holding user interface, if the page.js is part of "src/app" folder which has root file(index.html) called as landing page.

layout.js
   It is going to hold root layout,Which is a required file.

        "Every Nextjs app must have this "src/app/layout.js" file



What is this files are all about?

 "React Components"

Page Component - page.js
Layout Component - layout.js

.....................................................................................
			 React core features inside next js
.....................................................................................
1.Component:
   In react every thing is component, in next also the component driven arch is followed.

2.Props
    In react data is passed to the component via props.

Types of Props:
1.Data as prop
2.State as Prop -Dynamic Prop
3.function as Prop- Listeners as Prop
4.Component as Prop

Component as Prop syntax we use heavily.

Component Rendering:

function Tab(props){
   return <> {props.children} </>
}

<Tab/> - Self Closing
 There is no child elemement

<Tab>
    <Grid/> -  Component as Prop
<Tab>
.....................................................................................
			 Every thing is component  in Next.js
.....................................................................................
Page Component:
  It is place holder component which displays ui.

Layout Component:
  It is container component which holds Page Component


           layout - parent
	  ------------------------------
          |                             |
                      Page -child       |
          |                             |
          |                             |
          |                             |
           -----------------------------

How to declare compoents?

 1.every component must be "functional component" - No Class Component.
 2.every component must be exported using "export default" only.
 3.Every Next application must have "root layout" src/app/layout.js
 4.Every Next application must have  "home/landing page" src/app/page.js
 5.Component Name can be any thing like HomePage,Home,MyHomePage.

How to create Page and layout Components ?

src/page.js

//index.html - landing page

export default function HomePage(){
    
  return <div id="homePage">
       <h1>Home Page</h1>
  </div>
}

src/layout.js


//Layout is root component

// export default function RootLayout(props) {

//   return <html lang="en">
//     <body>
//       <div id="rootLayout">
//         {props.children}
//       </div>
//     </body>
//   </html>
// }

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return <html lang="en">
    <body>
      <div id="rootLayout">
        {children}
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
}
.....................................................................................
			  File Conventions- Types of files
.....................................................................................

1.layout.js
  Shared UI for a segment(page/router) and its children
  if a layout.js presents inside src/app folder which is called root layout.
  every next.js app must have one layout.js which is root layout file.

2.nestedlayout -layout.js
   Shared UI for a a segement and its children
  when you define routing, that time we may or not use layout...

  root layout vs nested layout:
     root layout must have <html>,nested layout <div> or section elements


Root Layout:

 <html>
  <head></head>
  <title>title</title> 
   <body>
	<nested Layout>Insert Page</nestedLayout>
   </body>
 </html>

3.page.js
  Unique UI of a route,meaning the page is mapped against routing like "/",index,products,users,customers

4.loading.js
   Loading UI (Spinner) for a segement and its children

5.not-found.js
   Not Found UI for a segment and for its children
   if routing is failed to map against a page, then next.js will show error page.

6.error.js
  It is used to show custom component logic errors.

Note:
  All error files are represented by "React Error Boundary".

7.global-error.js
  It is to show app level errors.

8.template.js:
   Specailzied re-rendered layout UI.

9.route.js
   you can write "restfull" web services".

10.default.js
    Fallback UI for "Parrel Routes"

Note:
 When we write next application, every thing is component
  Error is component
  Loading is Compoent
  Page is component
  Layout is compoent.

Since Everything is compoent , which forms component hierachy.

React dev tool can used to look into the component hiearchy....

Using react dev tool we can look , next application....

Component Structure/Hierarchy:
..............................

<Layout>  - layout.js
   <Template> -template.js
	<ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error/>}> global-error.js
	   <Suspense fallback={<Loading/>}> -loading.js
		<ErrorBoundary fallback={<NotFound/>} -not-found.js
		    <Page/> -page.js	
		<ErrorBoundary>
           <Suspense>	
        </ErrorBoundary>
   </Template>	
</Layout>
....................................................................................
			   Routing
		       Pages and Layouts
....................................................................................


.....................................................................................

				Nested Folders and Routing:
.....................................................................................

1.src/app/welcome/page.js

export default function WelcomePage(){
    return <h1>Welcome Page</h1>
}

http://localhost:3000/welcome -----> it will show page.js content of welcome/page.js


Nested Layout:
  
src/app/layout.js - Root Layout.
 Every Next app must have one single root layout.	

src/app/welcome/layout.js  -Nested layout.
//nested layout.

export default function WelcomeLayout({ children }) {
    return <div id="welcome layout">
        {children}
    </div>
}

.....................................................................................
			       Deep Nesting
.....................................................................................

src/app/welcome/hello/page.js

export default function Hello(){
    return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

src/app/welcome/hello/layout.js
export default function HelloLayout({children}){

    return <div id="hellolayout">
            {children}
    </div>
}

Use Case:
  dashboard/settings
  dashboard/analytics
  dashboard/settings/profile
  dashboard/settings/password
  
  /dashboard/settings
